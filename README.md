# Case

Imagine you're a contributor to a component library and you're being tasked with creating a new component.
The new component you're going to be creating is an interactive star rating component and below is the design you've gotten from your designer.

The component must be accessible and it should be possible to input a rating between 1 and 5 stars with both **keyboard and mouse** interaction.

**Tip:** Don't waste time on setting up a huge project from scratch. We have created a boilerplate for you to use.

## Constraints for the solution:

- You must utilize web-components. We can recommend e.g. https://lit.dev/ and the included boilerplate is also based on Lit, but feel free to use any other framework to solve the case.
- You Must be using an open git repository.

## Delivery expectations

- Accessibility has been prioritized.
- Keyboard and mouse support is available.
- Oral presentation of the solution, including an explanation about decisions, reflections and possible limitations of the solution.

## Considerations and reflections

- Presentation should take no more than 15-20 minutes.
- Consider committing often.

## What we are looking for:

- Code, Communication & Presentation skills
- Domain knowledge of frontend web development
